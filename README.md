Using a sponataneous web application to create a data.json file
===============================================================

This is a concept application for a spontaneous web form that writes to a local JSON file.

Workflow
--------
1. Spin up a browser and web server.
2. Using html forms and any existing data.json create forms.
3. During a POST action, create or modify the data.json.
4. Lather, rinse, and repeat.

UPDATE
------
This is now a successful proof of concept.  I can use the built-in PHP web server to populate a form and then save out a data.json file.

Ideas
-----
1. Can this be converted into a PHAR file?
